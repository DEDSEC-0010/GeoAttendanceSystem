## üìã Prerequisites

- net9.0 SDK or later
- SQL Server (for database)
- Google Maps API key
- Modern web browser with geolocation support

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/DEDSEC-0010/GeoAttendanceSystem.git
cd GeoAttendanceSystem
```

2. Configure the application
   1.  **API Configuration (`GeoAttendance.API/appsettings.json`):**
       -   Update `ConnectionStrings:DefaultConnection` with your SQL Server details.
       -   Review and update `Jwt:Key` with a strong, unique secret. Ensure this key matches the one in the Web application's settings.
   2.  **Web Application Configuration (`GeoAttendance.Web/appsettings.json`):**
       -   Update `GoogleMaps:ApiKey` with your Google Maps API key.
       -   Verify `ApiSettings:BaseUrl` matches the running URL of the GeoAttendance.API (e.g., `http://localhost:5201`).
       -   Ensure `Jwt:Key` matches the one in the API application's settings.
   3.  **Database Setup:**
       -   Ensure the database specified in the connection string exists or can be created by Entity Framework Core.
       -   Run database migrations. After building the solution, you can do this by running the `GeoAttendance.API` project. It's configured to apply migrations on startup. Alternatively, use the .NET CLI: `dotnet ef database update --project GeoAttendance.API`.
   4.  **Initial Geofence Setup:**
       -   Once the application is running, log in as an administrator.
       -   Navigate to the Geofence management section to define initial geofence boundaries.

3. Running the Application
   -   Run the `GeoAttendance.API` project.
   -   Run the `GeoAttendance.Web` project.
   -   Access the web application through its configured URL.
